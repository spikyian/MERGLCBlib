/**
 * @file
 * Implementation of the MERGLCB BOOT service, supports the FCU and CBUS (PIC based)
 * bootloading protocol.
 * @details
 * The service definition object is called bootService.
 * In order to be compatible with the FCU bootloader there are additional
 * requirements for the parameter block which are actually supported by the MNS.
 *
 * Application code packed with the bootloader must be compiled with options:
 *  - XC8 linker options -> Additional options --CODEOFFSET=0x800 
 *  - This generates an error ::: warning: (2044) unrecognized option "--CODEOFFSET=0x800"
 * but this can be ignored as the option works
 * 
 * Then the Application project must be made dependent on the Bootloader 
 * project by adding the Bootloader to project properties->Conf:->Loading
 * The project hex fill will have the .unified.hex extension.
